diaspora(dot)el --- Simple Emacs-based client for diaspora*

This is in a very early stage of development...it will probably break some where. 

See diaspora stream:

(diaspora-get-entry-stream)

Post to diaspora:

(diaspora-post-to)

Check keybindings

C-c C-h

See images:

in the *diaspora stream* buffer type:

M-x diaspora-get-all-images 

and then 

diaspora-show-images

... It still needs some work.
